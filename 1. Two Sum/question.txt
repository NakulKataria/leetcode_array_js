question-Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

alternative solution-
function twoSum(nums, target) {
    let numMap = {}; // Hash table to store numbers and their indices
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let complement = target - nums[i];
        
        if (numMap.hasOwnProperty(complement)) {
            return [numMap[complement], i]; // Return the indices of the two numbers
        }
        
        numMap[nums[i]] = i; // Store the index of the current number
    }
    
    return []; // This case won't occur as per the problem statement
}

solution using gpt includes mapping of index to number at it using object after every iteration if the if - block fails 
so that look up for complement'index is faster
